Let's get started with spatial data in R!

## The Science of Where

Spatial analysis allows you to solve complex location-oriented problems and better understand where and what is occurring in your world. It goes beyond mere mapping to let you study the characteristics of places and the relationships between them.

</div>

## Spatial isn't Special (in R)

Spatial data, just like all other data in R, are combinations of vectors, matrices, and lists. These combinations of data are wrapped into specialized classes, and have many specialized methods to make working with them easier. Most of the functionality comes from the `sp` package for vector data, and `raster` package for raster data. In addition to these packages we will use a few other packages:

1. `rgdal` - an R wrapper to the open source [gdal library](https://www.gdal.org/)
2. `rgeos` - an R wrapper to the open source [geos library](http://trac.osgeo.org/geos)
4. `leaflet` - an R wrapper to the javascript library leaflet for interactive maps

```{r message=FALSE}
# before starting make sure we have a clean global environment
rm(list = ls())

# load libraries and set working directory
library(dplyr)
library(sp)
library(raster)
library(rgdal)
library(rgeos)
library(ggthemes)
library(magrittr)
library(leaflet)

```

*Check the footnotes for info about some of the warnings* [^1]

[^1]: The `raster` and `dplyr` libraries each have a function called `select`. In prefer to load `dplyr` first and have the `raster` library mask the `select` function in the `dplyr` library. In order to call the `select` function in the `raster` library we need to explicitly reference the library we want to use with two colons: `dplyr::select`. When using double colons the libraries namespace (list of functions, variable, etc.) is loaded, but not attached to the session. This allows us to call function from libraries we haven't explicitly loaded with `library()` or `requrie()` function. I have a tendancy to (over)use this method. It is very helpful when writing your own functions and libraries as those functions will not throw errors about a library not being loaded.

## Spatial Data

> Everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things
<p class="display-block text-right"><small>Waldo Tobler, <em>Tobler's first law of geography</em></small></p>

Remember back to module 1.1 [that vectors are a bunch of objects grouped together in an orderly line](http://naes.unr.edu/shoemaker/teaching/R-Bootcamp/module1_1.html#vector_objects_in_r). Spatial vectors are not the same thing. In a spatial context vector data are points, lines, and polygons. We can also call these geometries. These data strucutures are sets of coordinate pairs (x, y) that can have variables or attribute data associated with them (but not always). Raster data are matrices of cell values. I like to think of rasters a images; in fact satelite images of earth are often the source of raster data.

### Points

Points are the simplest spatial data structure to reason about. In this case each coordinate pair is a point. We can attach attribute data to the points. An example of points might be trees in a forest, and the attribute data are height, diameter, species, etc.

### Lines

Lines are a bit more complex. They are composed of many vertices that are connected. Each line can have data associated with it. The order of the connections is important. Roads or rivers are great examples, and might have data like width, speed limit, flow as attribute data.

In R lines can be one or more line objects. For instance, the Truckee River and all its tributaries can be a single lines (multi-line) object, composed of many line objects for each of the tributaries.

### Polygons

A polygon is a set of closed lines. It is very similar to lines, however the first vertex must also be the last vertex in order to close the polygon. Polygons can have holes in them, think an island in a lake, which is a polygon enclosed inside another polygon. And just like lines, multiple polygon objects can make up a single polygons (multi-polygons) object. For instance, a chain of islands. Each island is a single polygon. Together all the individual island polygons represent the entire island chain polygon (multi-polygon). 

I find polygons easier to think about, so in the examples below I will first review points, then polygons, then lines.

### Raster

Raster data divides area of interest into a grid to represent continuous (and sometimes discrete) data such as elevation. The grid has equally sized rectangular cells (or pixels) that can have one or more values. The size of the cells refered to as the resolution of the grid, smaller cell sizes are higher resolution. The value of that cell should represent the average value for the area that cell covers. Raster data is often represented by a matrix of the spatial extent we are interested in. So if we have a 1km square area of interest with a 1 meter resoltion we have 1000 x 1000 matrix, each element of that matrix representing the value of a variable for that 1 meter cell.

We will likely not have much time to cover raster data because of our limited time together, and the amount of time loading and working with raster can take. I'll provide a few short examples at the end to run on your own.  

## Projections & Coordinate Reference Systems

<div style="margin: 16px 0">
  <img class="img-responsive center-block" src="assets/geoid.jpg" alt="The shape of the earth", width="50%" align="middle">
  <figcaption class="figure-caption" style="color:grey; margin-left:30px; margin-right:30px; margin-top:8px; font-style:italic;">This figure represents on of the most accurate representations of the shape of the earth, or geoid, the global mean sea level.</figcaption>
</div>

An important component of all spatial objects is the projection of the data. Projections attempt to map the round/oval shape of the earth onto a flat surface. Without a projection vector data are refered to as geometries. Once the projection is added it is geographic data.

<div style="margin: 16px 0">
  <img class="img-responsive center-block" src="assets/projections.gif" alt="ana animation of different geographic projections" align="middle">
  <figcaption class="figure-caption" style="color:grey; margin-left:30px; margin-right:30px; margin-top:8px; font-style:italic;">Watch how the representatino of the earth changes as the projections change</figcaption>
</div>

There are several methods to add a projection to `sp` and `raster` objects. The underlying structure of a projection string is from the [PROJ.4 open source library](https://proj4.org/). These are often refered to as a coordinate reference system (CRS). A common shorthand for creating CRSs is to use an EPSG id[^2].

Below is a list of common projections:

1. WGS84 ([EPSG:4326](epsg.io/4326)) - Latlong used in GPS systems
2. Pseudo-Mercator ([EPSG:3857](epsg.io/3857)) - Used in web maps
3. NAD83 zone 11n ([EPSG:26911](epsg.io/26911)) - North America metric based, Nevada. Can be used across zone lines, however accuracy suffers, especially further North
4. NAD27 zone 11n ([EPSG:26711](epsg.io/26711)) - Old, replaced by NAD83. Works best within zone lines. Don't use this, convert old data to NAD83.
5. Albers Equal-area Conic ([EPSG:102003](epsg.io/102003)) - Used by the USGS and US Census

[^2]: The European Petroleum Survey Group maintains a list of IDs to all the projection systems. These are a nice shorthand for create coordinate reference strings in R. [epsg.io](epsg.io) is a great interactive site to discover EPSG IDs.

## Spatial Objects

You will most likely load spatial data from shapefiles, Google kml or kmz files, or .gpx files. However, I imagine a lot of you are collecting point data in the field and transcribing it into Excel Spreadsheets. These will need to be converted from `data.frames` to `SpatialPointsDataFrames`. So below we will create a `SpatialPointsDataFrame` by hand, and load a `SpatialPolygonsDataFrame` from a shapefile

### Creating Spatial Points Data

Let's start out by creating a `SpatialPoints` object. 

```{r create_sp_points}
# create spatial points data frame ----
## load reptile data 
reptiles <- readr::read_csv('data/reptiles.csv')

## create a SpatialPoints object
sp_points <- SpatialPoints(
  coords = reptiles[, c('x', 'y')]
)

## inspect the SpatialPoints object
str(sp_points)

```

`sp_reptiles` contains an object of class `SpatialPoints`. It doesn't have any data associated with it, or a projection. Let's work on giving this data a projection. You will need to know the projection the data is recorded in order to acurately project the data. I know that the data is NAD83 Zone 11.

```{r sp_points_add_projection}
# add a projection to a spatial object ----
## create a CRS object
utm <- CRS('+init=epsg:26911')

## add the projection to sp_points
sp_points@proj4string <- utm

## inspect SpatialPoints
str(sp_points)

```

Nice, the data can now be plotted onto the earth! But first, lets add some data to these points with the `SpatialPointsDataFrame` function

```{r create spointsdf}
# add data to sp_points ----
spdf_points <- SpatialPointsDataFrame(coords = sp_points, data = reptiles)

## inspect the data
str(spdf_points)

```

Now we have a `SpatialPointsDataFrame`! And just like `data.frames` we can use indexing to subset the data. Check the data in the `@data` slot. One of the columns is species. Lets use this column to subset the data frame for only desert horned lizards (**Phrynosoma platyrhinos*).

```{r subset_spdf}
# subset a SpatialPointsDataFrame ----
## first, inspect the data in the @data slo
head(spdf_points@data)

## great, it looks just like a data.frame
## lets look at the species column, I'll only return the first 10
spdf_points@data$species[1:10]

## another way to do this
spdf_points$species[1:10]

## or, another method
spdf_points@data[1:10, 'species']

## cool, this thing behaves just like a data frame. Lets subset it.
## create a variable to hold our species of interest
phpl <- 'Phrynosoma platyrhinos'

## then subset the data...
phpl_spdf <- spdf_points[spdf_points$species == phpl, ]

## check to see that there is only one species in the data.frame
phpl_spdf %>% magrittr::extract2('species') %>% unique()

```

We can use any of the operation for a `data.frame` to work with a `SpatialPointsDataFrame`. One more thing before we move on. We can create a `SpatialPointsDataFrame` in one step, skipping the creation of a `SpatialPoints` object.

```{r one_step_spatialpointsdataframe}
# one step to create a SpatialPointsDataFrame ----
spdf1 <- SpatialPointsDataFrame(
  coords = reptiles[, c('x', 'y')],
  data = reptiles,
  proj4string = utm
)
str(spdf1, max.level = 2)

## and lets clean up the global env
rm(phpl_spdf, reptiles, sp_points, spdf1, phpl)

```

### ASIDE: Slots

Look carefully at the structure of an `sp` data. You will notice there are `@` signs used to separate different attributes or properties of data within an `sp` class. These are called slots. They are a special attribute to certain data types in R. You can think of the `@` like the `$` for `data.frames`. They are just ways to organize, set, and get certain bits of data out of classes.

### Loading SpatialPolygons

It is possible to create polygons from scratch in R. It takes a bit of work, and I'll provide an example later for reference. Most of the time you will not need to do this. Instead you will likely load data from a shapefile. In the code example below we are going to load county polygons for the state of Nevada. Like everything in R there are multiple methods to read shapefiles. The easiest method I've seen is to use the `raster::shapefile` function.

```{r read_shapefile}
# read in nv county shapefile ----
counties <- shapefile('data/nv_counties/NV_Admin_Counties.shp')

## once finished check the structure
str(counties, max.level = 3)

## some data management
### check the proj4string
counties@proj4string

### this proj4string, while encoding the same projection isn't identical to 
### the proj4string of spdf_points
spdf_points@proj4string

identicalCRS(counties, spdf_points)

### let's coerce the points to our desired CRS, utm
### this will throw a warning because we counties already has a projection
### and we are forcing a new (albeit same) projection onto it. This isn't
### the same as reprojecting, which we will get to later
proj4string(counties) <- utm

```

A little more complex than the points data. Instead of a `@coords` slot there is a `@polygons` slot. This contains the shape information for each polygon that makes up the state. Check the structure of a polygon. For more information about the structure of `SpatialPolygons` and `SpatialPolygonsDataFrames` [check here](https://www.maths.lancs.ac.uk/~rowlings/Teaching/UseR2012/cheatsheet.html).

```{r check_polygons}
## check structure of a polygon within a SpatialPolygonsDataFrame
str(counties@polygons[[1]])

```

Lets quickly plot this data to see what it looks like. We don't have to do anything special to plot spatial data in R. It is just like a plotting data from a `data.frame`, except we don't have to specify an x & y value because spatial class methods already know where to find the x & y values in spatial classes.

```{r plotting_spatial_polygon_1}
## plot a spatial polygon
plot(counties, col = 'springgreen', border = 'purple', lwd = 3)

## we can plot certain polygons...
layout(matrix(1:3, ncol = 3, nrow = 1))
plot(counties[1, ])
plot(counties[1:4, ])
plot(counties[counties$CNTYNAME == 'Clark', ])

## we can even plot our reptile points ontop of the counties
layout(matrix(1))
plot(counties)
points(spdf_points, pch = 1, cex = .5, col = 'purple')

```

## GIS Operations

### Spatial Joins

Spatial joins are executed by using the `over` (or `%over%`) function from the `sp` library. The behavior of `over` depends on the types of data used. However the basic idea when we are running an spatial join with `over` is: For each item in the first geometry, where does item intersect the second geometry.

```{r spatial_joins} 
# Spatial joins ----

## use the %over% funcstion, which is the same as over(spdf_points, counties)
rslt <- spdf_points %over% counties

## what does rslt look like?
str(rslt)

```

`rslt` is an `data.frame` with 60,955 observations of 6 variables. If you look at `spdf_points` we see that there are 60,955 elements. If you look at `counties@data` you will see that there are 6 variables. To reiterate `over` has taken each point in our first geometry, `spdf_points`, and looked at the polygons in counties to see which polygon that point lies within, then created a row of a new `data.frame` of the polygon data. 

We can bind this new `rslt` object with the data in `spdf_points`. Lets only use the county name though.

```{r cbind_rslt}
## bind data in rslt to spdf_points
spdf_points$county <- rslt$CNTYNAME

## remember back to one of our plot above that some points
## fall outside nevada
plot(counties)
points(spdf_points, col = 'purple')

## lets remove those from our dataset, as we shouldn't have any collections
## outside nevada and these are data entry mistakes
spdf_points <- spdf_points[!(is.na(spdf_points$county)), ]

## now lets plot, for fun
plot(counties)
points(spdf_points[spdf_points$county == 'Clark', ], col = 'springgreen', cex = .5)

```

### Merge Polygons

We can do the same thing with two polygon geometries. Let's create a second geometry to intersect with the counties geometry. I'll create a grid of square polygons that we will call study areas.

```{r spatial_join_polygons}
# create a study grid ----
## this code is used to create a SpatialPolygonsDataFrame grid
## it isn't important that you understand it right now
bb <- counties@bbox

grd <- GridTopology(
  cellcentre.offset = c(bb[1, 1] + 50000, bb[2, 1]), 
  cellsize = c(150000, 150000),
  cells.dim = c(4, 6)
)

p_grd <- SpatialPolygonsDataFrame(
  Sr = as.SpatialPolygons.GridTopology(grd),
  data = data.frame('study_area' = 1:24),
  match.ID = F)
proj4string(p_grd) <- utm

## plot the  grid and counties
layout(matrix(1:2, nrow = 1, ncol = 2))
plot(p_grd, main = 'Study Areas')
text(coordinates(p_grd), label = row.names(p_grd))

plot(counties, main = 'Nevada Counties')
text(coordinates(counties), label = counties$CNTYNAME, cex = .75)

```

Our goal is to attempt to intersect the two of the geometries together and try to create a new set of polygons. These new polygons will be a mash up of our two starting geometries. It'll make more sense as we work through the example. Instead of using the `over` command we will use the `gIntersection` command. We could also run this example using `raster::intersect`. But for now, do the following:

```{r intersection}
# intersect 2 polygon geometries ----
## a little data management to make the intersection easier
row.names(counties) <- counties$COV_NAME

## intersect the geometries
intersect <- gIntersection(counties, p_grd, byid = T)

## plot the result, color to show that they are separate
plot(intersect, col = blues9)

## check the structure
str(intersect, max.level = 2)

```

You'll notice that now we have 58 polygons. There isn't any data associated with these polygons. That was all dropped as a result of the `gIntersect` operation, which is slightly annoying, but we can fix that. 

*Note: many functions from `rgeos` will drop the data.frame from the result. If you supply the parameter `byid = T` to the function, you will be able to get the attribute data from either geometry*

```{r get_intersection_data}
# getting our data back from the intersection ----
## check the row.names of these polygons
row.names(intersect)

## these appear to be a concat of the first geometries row.names, and 
## the second geometries row.names. We can work with that to get our data
## strsplit returns a list
tmp <- strsplit(row.names(intersect), split = ' ')


## iterate over the list to get either the 1st or 2nd element
county_name <- vapply(tmp, FUN = '[[', FUN.VALUE = '', 1)
study_area <- vapply(tmp, FUN = '[[', FUN.VALUE = '',  2)

## now we now which county and study area each polygon belongs to
## store this data in a data.frame
df_names <- data.frame(county_name = county_name, study_area = study_area, row.names = row.names(intersect))

## let's add the area of each polygon to this data.frame
## remember that the area for each polygon is stored
## with each Polygon object, and is in square meters
## below we will get the area and convert it to square kilometers
intersect@polygons[[1]]@area / 1e6

## lets iterate over the object to get this data
parea <- vapply(seq_along(intersect), FUN = function (i) { intersect@polygons[[i]]@area / 1e6 }, FUN.VALUE = numeric(1))
df_names$area <- parea

## finally, create a SpatialPolygonsDataFrame
new_polys <- SpatialPolygonsDataFrame(Sr = intersect, data = df_names)

## and just for completions sake... plot it
layout(matrix(1:3, nrow = 1, ncol = 3))
### plot colored by county
plot(new_polys, col = ggthemes::gdocs_pal()(17)[new_polys$county_name])

### plot colored by study area
plot(new_polys, col = ggthemes::gdocs_pal()(20)[new_polys$study_area])

### plot differentiating each polygon
plot(new_polys, col = blues9)

```

That was a lot of code! With some new concepts. Allow me to try and explain that in plain english. 

`rgeos` doesn't know which data to keep from each geometries `@data` slot. So it returns a concatenation of row names from the two geometries. This is the join part of the operation. We are still interested in the data from each of the parent geometries. In order to get that data from each geometry we can use `strsplit` to split the row names string. Which ever geometry you put first in the `gIntersection` function will be the first element, the second will be the second element, etc... 

`strsplit` returns a list of *n* elements, where *n* is the number number of splits `strsplit` finds in the supplied string. In the example above I know that each row name is 1 word. So each list item has 2 elements. Instead of writing a for loop to extract each element from the list I used `vapply` (a function from the [`apply` family](https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/programming.html#the-apply-family) of functions). This function iterates over a list or vector (iterable) object, performs the actions in the given function, and returns a vector (a real, [useful stackoverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3505701/grouping-functions-tapply-by-aggregate-and-the-apply-family) to help you decide when to use which `apply` function). Another thing to remember is that almost everything in R is a function call. Even a generic `1 + 1` is really, <code>`+`(1, 1)</code>. The function I am calling is the Extract function `[[`. As a quick example try the following in R.

```{r clarification}
# Everything in R is a function call, almost ----
## are the following equal?
1 + 1 == `+`(1, 1)

## how about these?
county_name[[1]] == `[[`(county_name, 1)

```

`vapply` is used again to return a vector of the area of each polygon. The area, county name, and study area are used to create a `data.frame`. Then a new `SpatialPolygonsDataFrame` is created for the intersection.


### Union Polygons

Another common GIS task is to union sets of polygons into 1 bigger polygon. This is a common operation if you are trying to create a boundary to clip other data to (like when using the `over` function). Sometimes this operation is refered to as dissolving polygons.

```{r unions}
# unioning polygons ----
## all of these function come from the rgeos package.
## select two counties to union
plot(counties[2:3, ])

## union them
nnv <- gUnion(counties[2, ], counties[3, ])

## plot the result
plot(nnv)

## inspect
str(nnv)

rm(nnv)

# union all interior polygons ----
## we ccan do the same thing to get a the border of NV
## use a different function, but same idea
nv <- gUnaryUnion(counties)
plot(nv)

```

### Reproject

In order to convert coordinates from one CRS to another we need to use the `spTransform` and provide the CRS we want to reproject the data into. Below we will reproject the data from NAD83 zone 11 to WGS84.

```{r reproject}
# spTranform ----
## reproject
wgs_pts <- spTransform(spdf_points, CRS('+init=epsg:4326'))

## inspect coordinates
wgs_pts@coords[1:5, 1:2]

## we can do this to polygons too
wgs_counties <- spTransform(counties, CRS('+init=epsg:4326'))

## then we can plot the two counties projection side by side
layout(matrix(1:2, nrow=1, ncol=2))

plot(counties, main = 'UTM NAD83 zone 11')
plot(wgs_counties, main = 'WGS84')

```

There are many, many different projection, as stated in the projections section above. We can choose to project our data however we want. Ultimately, the most important apsect of projections (and spatial data) is that we document the projection of our data. Without a projection we can't plot our points onto earth. So please, do everyone a favor and document your data's projection.

Below is a figure demonstrating how the shape of Nevada counties change depending on the projection. You can find a list of all these projections, and many more, at the [PROJ4 website](https://proj4.org/operations/projections/index.html)

```{r many_projections}
## we can do this with other reprojections as well so you can really tell a difference
layout(matrix(1:8, nrow = 2, ncol = 4))
plot(spTransform(counties, CRS('+proj=aea')), main = 'Albers Equal Area', sub = 'USGS')
plot(spTransform(counties, CRS('+proj=sinu')), main = 'Van Der Grinten')
plot(spTransform(counties, CRS('+proj=robin')), main = 'Robinson')
plot(spTransform(counties, CRS('+proj=isea')), main = 'Icosahedral Snyder')
plot(spTransform(counties, CRS('+proj=wintri')), main = 'Winkel-Tripel', sub = 'National Geographic')
plot(spTransform(counties, CRS('+proj=goode')), main = 'Goode Homolosine')
plot(spTransform(counties, CRS('+proj=eqc')), main = 'Plate Carree')
plot(spTransform(counties, CRS('+proj=gall')), main = 'Gall-Peters')
```

## Raster Data

You will almost always read raster data from external files. There are many different file types to store raster data. The most common is probably .tif, or .geotiff. R has a native raster format that is very compact with an extension .grd & .gri (there are two files). We will use this format to read in raster data.

```{r rasters}
# working with raster data ----
## save some data for later
save(counties, spdf_points, wgs_pts, file = 'data/module2_3.RData')

## let's clean our workspace first
rm(bb, df_names, grd, intersect, new_polys, nnv, p_grd, rslt, tmp, wgs_counties, county_name, parea, study_area, counties, spdf_points, wgs_pts)

## load a raster
dem <- raster('data/nv_dem_coarse.grd')

## check dem structure
str(dem)

## what is this?
dem@data@inmemory

```

Wow, that is a lot of data packed into a single class. Check that last command. What does that mean? Well, the Raster package cleverly keeps raster data saved in on disk, in a temporary file, rather than loading it into memory. This is a very nice feature because raster data can be huge. Don't let anyone tell you differently, geographic data was the first big data!

How about plotting the data? We have two different methods, `plot` and `image`. The essentially do the same thing. Pick your favorite.

```{r plot a raster}
## plot raster
plot(dem)

## or
image(dem, asp = 1)

```

Let's load a second raster. This next one represents major roads in Nevada (from the Census TIGER dataset). I've converted the data from a `SpatialLinesDataFrame` to a `raster` so that we can do some computations with it. The plot below looks like a road network. If you look closely down near Las Vegas you'll see some green. Those cells are all the roads and highways lumped together in a single raster cell. The value of each cell in this data is the number of roads in that cell.

```{r distance to roads raster}
# load a second raster, distance to roads ----
road_rast <- raster('data/road_dist.grd')

## plot
plot(road_rast)

```

Check the projection on our Raster objects. The rasters we just loaded should be the same. What about when we compare it to `nv`? This is one of those instances, again, where the datasets are using the same coordinate reference system, however two different methods have been used to apply that coordinate reference system to the data. To prove they are the same coordinate reference system, we can plot the state border over the dem raster. 

```{r check raster projection}
## us the raster::projection function
projection(road_rast)
projection(dem)
identicalCRS(road_rast, dem)

## compare to nv SpatialPolygonsDataFrame
identicalCRS(dem, nv)
projection(nv)

## proof these are the same crs
plot(dem)
plot(nv, lwd = 3, add = T)

## coerce projection
dem@crs <- nv@proj4string
road_rast@crs <- nv@proj4string
identicalCRS(dem, nv)

## check that we haven't screwed things up
plot(dem)
plot(nv, lwd = 3, add = T)
```

If we wanted to reproject the raster into a different coordinate reference system we would use the `raster::projectRaster` function. One of the parameters for this function is `filename`. This parameter allows you to give the function a filename so that data is saved onto disk as the operation progresses, rather than saving it in memory. Most of the time you should specify a filename when working with rasters.

### Distance to Roads

Lets create a distance to roads raster from `road_rast`. We can later use this to perform spatial overlays, intersections, or joins. This should be a relatively quick operation. If you have an older computer with a slower processor and few RAM patience is required.

```{r distance to roads}
# create distance to roads ----
road_dist <- distance(road_rast, filename = "output/road_dist.grd", overwrite = T)

## cool, what does this look like?
plot(road_dist)
```

Very cool! This raster represents a continuous measure of distance to roads across the landscape. White pixels are directly on roads, so the cell value is 0. The darker the and greener the color, the further away from major roads that cell is. The units for each cell are meters. This isn't as clean as the DEM we have loaded. The lower left corner is all in California, and because we didn't include any California roads in the calculation of this raster, that data isn't accurate. Instead of including California roads we will clip or mask this raster to the state border.

```{r clip raster}
## mask raster to NV border. This will set all values outside NV to NA
nv_road_dist <- mask(road_dist, mask = nv, filename = 'output/nv_road_dist.grd', overwrite = T)

```

*If you need to overwrite a file that already exists on disk provide the `overwrite = T` parameter. Without this the operation will error out.*

```{r plot new raster}
## plot our new raster, with nevada border
plot(nv_road_dist)
plot(nv, lwd = 3, add = T)
```

The appearance of the raster changed but the data is still the same. The change in appearance is due to the range of our cell values. Check for yourself. Removing all those extremely large values from California changes the distribution of our cell values.

```{r compare cell values}
## compare raster values
summary(road_dist)
summary(nv_road_dist)

```

### Overlay Operations

We can perform overlay operations between vector and raster geometries, similar to what we did with two raster geometries. When interacting with raster-vector geometries this is referred to as extraction. The easiest way for me to think about this is with point data. We want to provide additional attribute data to the points by extracting the cell value from a raster at that points' position. 

```{r raster extractions}
# raster extraction ----
## global env setup
rm(road_dist, road_rast)
load('data/module2_3.RData')
## the following command might not do anything, however there may be some additional data in the .RData file that we don't need
rm(counties, wgs_pts)

```

Before we do anything else, lets visualize what we are trying to do. In the figure below we have several points ontop of the elevation DEM for Humboldt county. For each point on the map we want to get the value of the raster cell underneath that point.

```{r visualize the problem}
## create an extent object to limit the size of our raster plot
## wubset the points so we can see them
bounds <- extent(spdf_points[spdf_points$county == 'Humboldt', ])

## extend the extent object so all the points fit on the map
plot(dem, ext = extend(bounds, 10000))
points(spdf_points[spdf_points$county == 'Humboldt', ])

```

Now let's do the extraction.

```{r the extraction dem}
## extract values from the dem
## this returns a vector of length = nrow(spdf_points)
elevation <- raster::extract(dem, spdf_points)
summary(elevation)

## this can be combined with our data
## and yes, this can be done in one step instead of 2
spdf_points$elevation <- elevation

```

Once the extraction is complete, and we add this column to our data we can do some data exploration. There are some `NA` values, what is that about? We can also plot a histogram and see the distribution of elevations for our data.

```{r explore data}
## and now, we can figure out the distribution of elevations in our data!
hist(spdf_points$elevation * 3.28, main = 'Distribution of Elevation', xlab = 'Elevation (ft)', freq = F)

## what about those NAs?
na_points <- spdf_points[is.na(spdf_points$elevation), ]
## honestly, this 2000 number is purely experimental, 
## change values till you get what you want on the map
bounds <- extend(extent(na_points), 2000)

## plot the map, zoom in on these points in the map
plot(dem, ext = bounds)
points(na_points)
plot(nv, add = T)

```

This is due to the fact that a raster is a grid of rectangles (squares) and we can't perfectly mimic every vector shape. A solution is to use smaller resolutions for rasters, or buffer the state border to include cells outside the state.

## Interactive Maps

I'll often hear that many people don't use R as a GIS because it is hard to add basemaps. Well, some wonderful R user decided to write a library that allows for interactive mapping in R. Underneath the hood this library is calling a JavaScript library called leaflet.

```{r interactive}
rm(list = ls())
load('data/module2_3.RData')

# interactive mapping ----
leaflet::leaflet(wgs_pts[1:100, ]) %>% 
  addTiles() %>% 
  addCircleMarkers(radius = 5)

```

We can change the basemap too.

```{r}
## leaflet provider tiles
leaflet::leaflet(wgs_pts[1:100, ]) %>% 
  addProviderTiles(providers$Esri.WorldTopoMap) %>% 
  addCircleMarkers(radius = 5)
```

And popups! Click on a point.

```{r popups}
## and popups
leaflet::leaflet(wgs_pts[1:100, ]) %>% 
  addTiles() %>% 
  addCircleMarkers(radius = 5, popup = paste(wgs_pts$species[1:100]))
```

## Challenge: Spatial Lines

Lines are very similar to polygons. See if you can load a shapefile of lines and plot it over the counties.

1. Read in the roads shapefile
2. reproject to match the counties CRS
3. Plot counties and roads
4. Plot roads based on road type
4. Intersect counties and roads
5. Plot some intersections

```{r spatial_lines_starter, eval = F}
# SpatialLines solution ----
## 1. read in data
### HINT: use readshapefile
### data to use:
#### data/roads/roads.shp
#### data/counties/counties.shp

## 2. reproject
### HINT: check counties projection

## 3. plot

## 4. plot roads, style based on road type 

## 5. intersect counties and roads

## 6. plot some of the intersections

## etc ...

```
